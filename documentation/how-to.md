### Create your ASP .NET MVC application

In Visual Studio go to the File menu and select _File > New > Project_

Click on _Web_ and copy the _Project Url_ value. We will need this information when specifying the Authorization callback URL in GitHub.

### Register your application in GitHub

In order for you to use GitHub as an OAuth authentication provider in your web application, you will need to create an application in GitHub. 

If you do not already have a GitHub account, register for one following [these](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/ "Sign up for a new GitHub account") steps.

Sign in to your GitHub account and navigate to your Account settings by clicking on the _Settings_ icon on the top right of the GitHub website.

Choose a name for your application and set it at the _Application name_ field. Optionally, set a description at the _Application description_ field. Paste at the _Homepage URL_ the Project Url value you copied earlier from Visual Studio.

Select _Register application_ to save the information.

Once the application registration is complete your will be redirected to the application page. Note the _**Client ID**_ and _**Client Secret**_ information. Copy the values as you will need them shortly in order to enable the GitHub authentication in your ASP.NET MVC application.
